# Hello people 👋

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juanfrank77/juanfrank77/master/tech-bg.png" alt="Tech Background">

I'm Juan Gonzalez. A systems engineer with a kind of accidented career path. I have always been more interested in the user interface and its interaction with sites & apps. 

I want to make things look good, be intuitive of use and accessible to people across languages, borders and cultures.

## What I'm doing 

👨‍💻 I’m currently working as a Web Engineer at a company called [Huge](https://www.hugeinc.com/).

📚 I'm learning more about UI development, web apps, accessibility, performance, and other related topics.

## Misc

🤝 I like to collaborate with others in open-source projects of knowledge management and edtech. Also, growing tech communities in Latam.

💬 Ask me about: learning new things efficiently, overcoming procrastination/distractions/overwhelm, and doing more with less.
