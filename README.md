## Hello people 👋

I'm Juan Gonzalez. A systems engineer with a weird career path. I was trained as a back-end developer but I have always been more interested in the user interface and the user interaction with different apps & programs. I want to make stuff look good, be intuitive of use and accessible to people across languages, borders and cultures.

## What I'm doing 

👨‍💻 I’m currently working at a wonderful company called [Globant](https://www.globant.com).

📚 I'm learning more about UI development, functional programming, tech effects on the brain and flow based focus.
