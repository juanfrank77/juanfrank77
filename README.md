# Hello people 👋

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juanfrank77/juanfrank77/master/tech-bg.png" alt="Tech Background">

I'm Juan Gonzalez. A systems engineer with a kind of accidented career path. I have always been more interested in the user interface and its interaction with sites & apps. 

I want to make things look good, be intuitive of use and accessible to people across languages, borders and cultures.

## What I'm doing 

👨‍💻 I’m currently working as a Freelance Web Developer and Writer.

🚧 I'm hacking away at a site for my learning notes and the V2.0 of [my website](https://www.juanfgonzalez.com)

📚 I'm learning more about writing, meta-learning, focused productivity, and knowledge management.

🎈 Fun fact: I was full into customer service and electronic music before working as a front-end dev.

## Misc

🤝 I like to collaborate with others in open-source projects of knowledge management and edtech. Also, helping out communities in the tech space.

💬 Ask me about: Using Git, web performance, learning new things quickly, and overcoming distractions.
