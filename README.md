### Hello people 👋

I'm Juan Gonzalez. A systems engineer with a bit of an accidented career path. I've always been interested in making apps & programs look good and be intuitive of use.

### What I'm doing 

👨‍💻 I’m currently working at a wonderful company called [Globant](https://www.globant.com).

📚 I'm learning more about UI development, ethical design for products and human performance enhanced by technology.

🤝 I like to collaborate in programs of research and knowledge management.

💬 Ask me about things related to learning new things, develop skills on the go, productivity, performance enhancement and the like.
