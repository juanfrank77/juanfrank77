# Hello people 👋

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juanfrank77/juanfrank77/master/tech-bg.png" alt="Tech Background">

I'm Juan Gonzalez. A systems engineer with an accidented career path. I have always been more interested in user interfaces and its application to sites & apps. 

I like to make things look good, intuitive to use and accessible to people across languages and locations.

I'm always learning something new, improving myself, and looking for others on a similar path.

## What I'm doing 

👨‍💻 I’m currently working as a technical writer and content creator.

🚧 I'm procrastinating on building the V2.0 of [my website](https://www.juanfgonzalez.com) (hopefully any time soon).

📚 I keep learning more about writing better, practical self-development, and now AI.

🎈 Fun fact: I spent many years in customer service and electronic music before working as a front-end dev.

## Misc

❌ I strongly dislike TypeScript and haven't had to used it much. I've also never used TailwindCSS (and never will). 

🤝 I have collaborated with others in open-source projects related to knowledge management and edtech. 

💬 Ask me about: Writing online, learning new things in record time, and developing your human skills.
