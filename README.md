# Hello people 👋

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juanfrank77/juanfrank77/master/tech-bg.png" alt="Tech Background">

I'm Juan Gonzalez. A systems engineer with an accidented career path. I have always been more interested in user interfaces and its application to sites & apps. 

I like to make things look good, be of intuitive use and accessible to people across languages and locations.

I'm always learning something new, improving myself constantly, and reaching out to others on a similar path.

## What I'm doing 

👨‍💻 I’m currently working as a Freelance content writer and developer.

🚧 I'm building the V2.0 of [my website](https://www.juanfgonzalez.com) and productizing my library of learning notes.

📚 I'm learning more about writing, meta-learning, focused productivity, and knowledge management.

🎈 Fun fact: I was full into customer service and electronic music before working as a front-end dev.
